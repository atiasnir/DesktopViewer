DesktopViewer
=============

This is a simple application for capturing the screen on multiple desktop platform. 
It is mainly intended for use when only one of the desktop is viewable (e.g. one desktop is on a projector).

A common scenario is when the desktop is extended over the 2nd monitor. Showing code may be difficult 
as the editing window is only viewable on the projected desktop, which may not be useful to the presenter.

DesktopViewer allows capturing of any of the available desktops in its main window. 

I hope you'll find it useful.

Notes
-----

1. I wrote it quickly as I did not find any (free) tool with this functionality -- so there are no guarantees.
2. This version is not very efficient and will copy the entire screen regardless of the changes made to it. I did not find this a real issue though.
3. Currently the list of available desktops is only built on startup and will not update when a new monitor is plugged.
